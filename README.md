A Discord bot that creates a quarantine system for a Discord server with multiple Discord bots in the making. Simply create "Buckets" which will automatically create a role and a category for you. You can give each bucket role very specific permissions and members in a bucket cannot view other buckets.

A very niche, and most likely unnecessary bot for most users, I only made it public so the source code is available for, maybe anyone who encounters the same problem of having one Discord server but currently working on a lot of bots. It can get very annoying managing which bot can access what.

Also can create landing messages for when people join to join "Public" buckets. Or, if they were added to the list with `buckets add` with their userId they will automatically be added to a bucket. Good for allowing others to test only one bot without having to juggle through all of them.
